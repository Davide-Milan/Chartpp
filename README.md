# Chartpp - Chart++


This is my submission for the project of the OOP course at the University of Padua (Italy).
The project consists in making a software that gives the user the capability of:
*     managing data (creation, deletion) via a graphic interface
*     saving and loading this data to and from a file
*     using this data to create at least 3 different types of charts to be displayed

What should be done:
*     -create a friendly and simple user interface to do everything, using the framework Qt
*     -separate logic and GUI
*     -inheritance with custom class gerarchy/gerarchies and polymorphism must be used
*     -students are free to handle everything else as they prefer, including the type of data to be used to make the charts and how to store the data via saving to a file

My own implementation of the project, called "Chartpp" (which is a play on words about the programming language used C++ => Cpp => Chartpp), utilizes JSON to save and load data
and lets users input either numeric or textual data in order to create and display 3 different types of charts (line chart, bar chart and pie chart) in a very easy way.
